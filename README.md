# Placement-Prediction

•	Developed a binary classification analysis to predict outcomes from benchmark data
•	Evaluated ten classifiers: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Classifier, Gaussian Naïve Bayes, AdaBoost Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier, Extra Trees Classifier, and Bagging Classifier
•	Final model: Gradient Boosting Classifier achieved perfect precision, recall, and f1 scores on test data with a cross-validated average accuracy of 96% (±0.11)
